[PHP Design Patterns With Example Code]

Creational design pattern

As the name implies, creational patterns are ones used to create objects. More specifi‐ cally,
they abstract the instantiation process. As a program comes to depend more on composition,
it depends less on hardcoded instantiations and more on a flexible set of behaviors that can be arranged
into a more complex set. Creational patterns provide ways to encapsulate knowledge
about which concrete classes a system uses and hide information about instance creation and composition.

Structural design pattern



The patterns concerned with the structure of compositions are structural.
 The structural class patterns employ inheritance to compose interfaces or implementations.
 The struc‐ tural object patterns describe ways to compose objects to establish new functionality.
 Understanding structural patterns contributes to understanding and using interrelated classes
as participants in a design pattern.
