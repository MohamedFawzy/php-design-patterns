            <p>A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud
               nomadic traditions, most of Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to
               Russia in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the
               Tsarist Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz
               population was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936
               and achieved independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide
               demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of
               President Askar AKAEV, who had run the country since 1990.
               Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won overwhelmingly
               by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Over the next few years,
               the new president manipulated the parliament to accrue new powers
               for himself. In July 2009, after months of harassment against
               his opponents and media critics, BAKIEV won re-election in a
               presidential campaign that the international community deemed
               flawed. In April 2010, nationwide protests led to the resignation
               and expulsion of BAKIEV. His successor, Roza OTUNBAEVA, served as
               transitional president until Almazbek ATAMBAEV was inaugurated in
               December 2011. Continuing concerns include: the trajectory of
               democratization, endemic corruption, poor interethnic relations,
               and terrorism.
